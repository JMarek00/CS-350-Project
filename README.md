# CS-350-Project
In SNHU's CS-350: Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies course, the final project involved developing a smart thermostat prototype using the TI board for SysTec. The prototype utilized the TMP006 temperature sensor to read room temperature, LEDs to indicate heating status, buttons to adjust the set temperature, and UART to simulate data sent to the server.

One particular strength was quickly grasping the Task Scheduler concept after studying ZyBooks and integrating past milestones effectively.

An area for improvement was understanding the underlying functioning of components like timers, GPIO, and UARTs, relying more on knowing which functions to use rather than understanding their workings.

To enhance support, I will continue using the Code Composer IDE, found easy to learn compared to Eclipse, and rely on ZyBooks and TI's documentation.

Transferable skills include proper research for building models like state machines and task schedulers, and adapting example codes to the project.

The project was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable by reusing code from past milestones, extensive commenting, and keeping the code simple for easy understanding and maintenance.
